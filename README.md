# 🏦 Python ATM GUI Application

A simple yet functional ATM simulator built using **Python**, **CustomTkinter**, and **MongoDB**, designed for multiple user handling, balance operations, and transaction history. This project offers a clean GUI interface to simulate ATM-like banking tasks.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a basic desktop-based ATM system clone. It allows users to create accounts, securely log in, and perform banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. Every action is recorded in a transaction history that users can review anytime.

The GUI is designed using [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) for a modern and smooth experience, while MongoDB handles all data and transaction persistence.
